# Data types practice

## Write a program that will build possible figures from given points:

#1
<ul>
  <li>the user sets points, the type of which is defined in the Point structure</li>
  <li>the program has classes that describe the logic of working with a square, rectangle and triangle</li>
  <li>the program should print to the console a list of possible shapes that can be built from these points, and width, height and area of figures</li>
</ul>

#2
<ul>
  <li>enter a number into the console - the number of points</li>
  <li>enter points into the console (the number indicated above)</li>
  <li>write in the structure only those points whose X coordinate is greater than zero and less than 20</li>
  <li>sort points by Y coordinate and display</li>
</ul>
