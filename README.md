# Data types practice

## Structure #1 
Write a program that will build possible figures from given points:
<ul>
  <li>the user sets points, the type of which is defined in the Point structure</li>
  <li>the program has classes that describe the logic of working with a square, rectangle and triangle</li>
  <li>the program should print to the console a list of possible shapes that can be built from these points, and width, height and area of figures</li>
</ul>

## Structure #2
<ul>
  <li>enter a number into the console - the number of points</li>
  <li>enter points into the console (the number indicated above)</li>
  <li>write in the structure only those points whose X coordinate is greater than zero and less than 20</li>
  <li>sort points by Y coordinate and display</li>
</ul>

## Strings #1
<ul>
  <li>enter a string into the console</li>
  <li>enter a character into the console</li>
  <li>remove entered character from string</li>
</ul>

## Strings #2
<ul>
  <li>enter a first string into the console</li>
  <li>enter a second string into the console</li>
  <li>insert second string before first</li>
  <li>compare run time with String and StringBuilder</li>
</ul>

## Arrays #1
Write custom collection that stores points (Point structures) and can:
<ul>
  <li>add item to collection</li>
  <li>remove item</li>
  <li>delete by index</li>
  <li>add by index</li>
  <li>iterate items in the foreach</li>
</ul>
