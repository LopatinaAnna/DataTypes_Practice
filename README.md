# Data types practice

## Write a program that will build possible figures from given points:

<ul>
  <li>the user sets points, the type of which is defined in the Point structure</li>
  <li>the program has classes that describe the logic of working with a square, rectangle and triangle</li>
  <li>the program should print to the console a list of possible shapes that can be built from these points, and width, height and area of figures</li>
</ul>
